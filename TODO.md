- Add nice docker labels like

  - org.label-schema.schema-version
  - org.label-schema.build-date
  - org.label-schema.name
  - org.label-schema.description
  - org.label-schema.vcs-url
  - org.label-schema.vcs-ref
  - org.label-schema.version

- but OTOH, i've never actually used one of these with my own images
  or found them useful, since I don't update them often. so maybe
  don't bother.
