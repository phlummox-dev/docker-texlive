# texlive-docker

Docker image with TexLive installed. Includes sufficient fonts and packages that
the standard LaTeX code generated by [rst2latex][rst] or [pandoc][pandoc] should
compile without problems. Also inclues `latexmk`.

[rst]: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/rst2latex.1.html
[pandoc]: https://pandoc.org/

## how to use

The image is pushed to the docker hub as `phlummox/texlive`.

So `docker run --rm -it phlummox/texlive`, bind-mount in whatever directory
contains your source, and build with e.g. `pdflatex` or `latexmk`.
